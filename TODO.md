## Agentic Workflow - Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Audit Data Layer ✅ COMPLETED

  - [x] Test edge cases (insufficient data, NaN handling) - ✅ Properly handled
  - [x] Validate technical indicator calculations - ✅ Verified

### Phase 2: Audit Strategy Layer ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Verify `strategies/xgb_strategy.py`**
  - [x] Confirm hyperparameter loading hierarchy (symbol-specific → generic → smart defaults) - ✅ Working

## Usage Examples

### Run with different prediction modes:
```bash
# Short-term prediction (1-3 days)
python main.py --symbol BTC/USDT --mode short

# Medium-term prediction (3-5 days, default)
python main.py --symbol BTC/USDT --mode medium

# Long-term prediction (5-10 days)
python main.py --symbol BTC/USDT --mode long
```

### Hyperparameter tuning with mode:
```bash
python tune.py --symbol SOL/USDT --mode short --trials 100 --save
```

```bash
python feature_analysis.py --symbol ETH/USDC --mode long
```
